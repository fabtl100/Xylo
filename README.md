# Xylo
This Visual Studio solution is part of my project for the Microprocessors class in my exchange semester in UANL. The solution is a Windows Forms project that can connect to an Arduino through the serial port to send songs in a string format so a robotic arm can play the songs in a xylophone.

## The project
The robotic arm is composed by two servo motors: one works as the base that can rotate to change the note to play in the xylophone and the other one is perpendicular to the first one working as the arm with a stick attached to it to play the xylophone. The following images can better illustrate this:
